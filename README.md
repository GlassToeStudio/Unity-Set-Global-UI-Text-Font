This package will allow one to select a default global font for Unity UI Text. 
The Global Font can be selected from a custom editor window. 
When a new UI Text (even if the Text is a Child, ex: Button) it will have the font that was set by the user, and not the default Arial font.

## Getting Started
   * Select a Font that is in your project to be the Global Font.
   * This can be set from **"Global Font/Settings"**
   * Now, when a UI Text is added, it will have this font.

     **Additional Options**
   * Button to *Reset* global font to default (Arial)
   * Button to Change the font of all UI Text in the scene at once
           *Useful if you already have a bunch of Text in a scene, and decide to use a new font*
